# Toast-Notification-with-Progress-Bar
A toast notification is a small pop-up message that appears on the screen to notify the user about an event or a task completion. It is typically used in web and mobile applications to provide real-time feedback to the user without interrupting their current workflow.

A toast notification with a progress bar is a notification that includes a progress bar in addition to the text message. The progress bar indicates the progress of a long-running task, such as a file upload or a software installation, and provides an estimate of the time remaining until the task is complete. This type of notification can be particularly useful for keeping users informed about the progress of tasks that take longer to complete.
